# Rollback Test

  previous_revision: #2, I ended up starting the deploy with the "v3" tag on canary deploy so I had to upgrade to version 2 and then a upgraded again to version 3, for that reason i use the revision 2.

# Additional Observations
observations:
  unexpected_behaviors: #The prometheus didn't set the canary-demo and the canary-demo-canary pods as a target, so i couldn't run the queries on prometheus graph. Even with suggested machine, it ran out of resources. 
  suggested_improvements: # use a local configuration file of the prometheus to have more control of the version and the configurations.
